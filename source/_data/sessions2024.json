Today, most of us are being asked to do something with AI; and if not today, then tomorrow. Quite simply, AI is going to touch on every part of our jobs soon enough.\r\n\r\nHowever, most of us aren’t AI researchers. It’s not our specialty. \r\n\r\nThat’s ok! We’re asked to do things we aren’t specialists in every day. We can leverage the skills we’ve developed to accelerate our learning of AI. The gap isn’t nearly as large as it may seem at first.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will provide a broad overview of the field, through the lens of five areas where AI is commonly used:\r\n\r\n* Making sense of the physical world\r\n* Structuring unstructured/unformatted data to be machinable\r\n* Predicting trends and group membership\r\n* Building plans and strategies\r\n* Generating media for human consumption\r\n\r\nFor each application area, we'll be looking at the underlying subfields of AI that seek to address it, discuss the common pitfalls and best practices in that space, and introduce tools that you can use to solve those problems today.",

Why the Minimum Viable Product framework fails miserably when attempting to replace legacy systems.\r\n2. The math behind why it’s impossible to accurately estimate scope, costs and timelines of complex projects.\r\n3.

Where to focus your initial UX and architectural research to avoid disastrous surprises toward the end of the project.\r\n5. And much, much more – all delivered via a series of colorful slides, clear examples and sixth-grade math formulas that you can use to impress your boss and colleagues.\r\n\r\nTo learn more prior to the session, you can read an introductory article on the subject at https://dontmakemework.com/2021/04/22/minimum-viable-replacement-a-new-framework-for-retiring-old-products-2/\r\n",
