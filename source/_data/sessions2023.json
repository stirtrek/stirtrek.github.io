In this session, I‚Äôll walk you through how we designed and built an Ingress Controller and have converted our clusters to use it in production to support millions of requests.

Our messages represent value, so we can't just slip them in a bottle, toss them into the ocean, and hope they arrive at their destination. Instead, we need a messaging backbone that can provide resilience and stability. Therefore, we implement proven messaging patterns, to ensure they are handled with the care they deserve.\r\n\r\nIn this session we will have a look at Azure Service Bus, and what role it takes in such designs. Through various demos, we will showcase its implementation with a wide variety of messaging patterns. As a result we come to understand how secure and reliable communication help us solve complex messaging challenges. \r\n\r\nCome and learn about handling transactions involving different systems, implementing data consistency across them, and controlling intermittent and critical failures.",

As Vue developers, we spend a great deal of time working with abstractions created by ourselves or others, and as such it can be easy to lose touch with the actual HTML output of our applications. \r\n\r\nThis is especially true when complicated interactivity is involved. In this talk we'll reflect on how we can use automated testing to focus on the accessible \"identity\" of our interactive features. By understanding the underlying patterns and testing them, we can make sure the application is behaving correctly and that our tests see through our architecture so that core accessible behaviors that matter to users don't get lost in the shuffle.\r\n\r\nWe will use Cypress as our test runner to show examples, but will focus on general ideas about what is being tested, and why, not the tool itself.",

While it's true that ChatGPT is capable of performing many tasks that were once the exclusive domain of humans, it's important to remember that ChatGPT is a tool, not a replacement for human workers. In fact, ChatGPT has the potential to help people get more done than ever before.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we'll explore the capabilities of ChatGPT and discuss how it can be used to streamline workflows, improve productivity, and make our lives easier. We'll look at real-world examples of how ChatGPT is being used today, from automating customer service to generating creative content. We'll also discuss the ethical considerations of using AI in the workplace and explore how we can ensure that we're using these tools responsibly.\r\n\r\nUltimately, the goal of this talk is to dispel the fear and uncertainty that surrounds AI and to show how ChatGPT can be a powerful ally in the workplace. Whether you're a business owner looking to improve efficiency or an employee looking to streamline your workload, ChatGPT has the potential to help you get things done like never before. So join us as we explore the exciting world of AI and discover how ChatGPT can help you achieve your goals.",

After all, it‚Äôs a constant stream of data that is literally being broadcast in real-time. But how can we capture these broadcasts and the data within? Surely it must require expensive hardware and special tools!\r\n\r\nNot so much. It turns out that we can capture ADS-B data easily using a combination of a cheap radio dongle and free software‚Äîa combination called software-defined radio. From there we can store it in a streaming data structure and consume, transform, and publish it using microservices. Cool, right?\r\n\r\nIn this session, you‚Äôll learn how software-defined radio works (and not just for ADB-S), how to receive and store ADS-B data in streams, and how to use those streams with microservices.

      "description": "‚ÄúTesters [do|don‚Äôt] (help) [prevent|detect] problems.‚Äù\r\n\r\nThroughout my career, I‚Äôve encountered numerous variations of this phrase and discussed the underlying ideas often. The phrase uses just a few, small words to express many, big ideas. And so, it is valuable and critical to understand what each word means individually in order to better understand the ideas they convey collectively.\r\n\r\nSemantics is the study of meaning in words. The session begins with a brief and broad overview of semantics and related ideas. This sets the stage for deep analysis of each individual word in the phrase above and its potential meaning. We collaboratively consider:\r\n\r\nTesters ‚Äì What might this word mean to different people and in different contexts?\r\nDo/Don‚Äôt ‚Äì What do normative and descriptive statements have to do with it?\r\nHelp ‚Äì How does the inclusion/exclusion of this word affect the meaning of the phrase?\r\nPrevent/Detect ‚Äì What does causality and relativism have to do with which word we choose?\r\nProblems ‚Äì What exactly is the thing that is being prevented or detected?\r\n\r\nThis session demystifies and promotes semantics, and goes beyond wordplay to introduce critical concepts that have practical impacts on testers, their roles, and their responsibilities.",
