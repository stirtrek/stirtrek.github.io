We've got a puzzle for you to solve.

There have been lots of questions about what movie will be shown at Stir Trek this year, and we decided to make it a
contest for the first person to guess correctly.

Here's your only clue.

Winner will receive a ticket to this year's event (or next year's, if you already have one), as well as DVD copies of
each film.
