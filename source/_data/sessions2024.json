      "description": "AI has captured the attention of the world—for better or worse. Hype, noise, and fear are dominating the headlines, with a huge focus on ChatGPT and its competitors. Today, most of us are being asked to do something with AI; and if not today, then tomorrow. Quite simply, AI is going to touch on every part of our jobs soon enough.\r\n\r\nHowever, most of us aren’t AI researchers. It’s not our specialty. \r\n\r\nThat’s ok! We’re asked to do things we aren’t specialists in every day. We can leverage the skills we’ve developed to accelerate our learning of AI. The gap isn’t nearly as large as it may seem at first.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will provide a broad overview of the field, through the lens of five areas where AI is commonly used:\r\n\r\n* Making sense of the physical world\r\n* Structuring unstructured/unformatted data to be machinable\r\n* Predicting trends and group membership\r\n* Building plans and strategies\r\n* Generating media for human consumption\r\n\r\nFor each application area, we'll be looking at the underlying subfields of AI that seek to address it, discuss the common pitfalls and best practices in that space, and introduce tools that you can use to solve those problems today.",

In this talk, I'll share my unique approach to debugging, likening it to a process as simple as changing a lightbulb. We'll embark on a journey to hunt down problematic function calls, figure out why data might not be delivering what you expect, identify the true source of a problem, and understand when it's time to seek help or recognize that an issue may be beyond your control. This talk aims to enhance your problem-solving skills in your daily programming tasks, making you more efficient, self-sufficient, and confident. Join me to learn how to debug your programming as easily as you would change a lightbulb. Let this talk be a guiding light for those having trouble debugging.",

User research, user testing, user feedback – the end user is at the heart of everything that we build. However, for many companies, making conversations with real users actually happen is a real challenge – especially if you don't have a UX specialist on your team! If this is all sounding familiar to you, then I have a recommendation: take it into your own hands. In this session, we'll talk through setting up a basic user testing program and growing it, so you – the developer – can feel empowered to start usability testing for your own product! ",

      "description": "API specifications like GraphQL and JSON:API were created so that clients such as an internal frontend or mobile application can have a standardized and robust way to get the data they need.\r\n\r\nAPIs that are built to conform to a spec have a schema and the patterns for interacting already established before any endpoints are written. This way, developers have established patterns and schemas to follow on both the client and server side which allows teams to build faster than in situations where this is not true.\r\n\r\nWhile implementing APIs to specs or migrating APIs to specs requires more work upfront, I’ve seen APIs that conform to specs like GraphQL and JSON:API scale quickly in terms of technical features. They also helped the project scale from 10 devs working quickly and effectively to 40 devs working effectively in a matter of a couple weeks.\r\n\r\nWhether you are part of a team building a new API or you are working in an established one you will come away from this talk feeling empowered and equipped to make that API better. You will understand why migrating to or building with a spec is worth the time as well as hear practical implementation strategies. Finally, you will see examples of the technical details so you can easily start working towards more scalable solutions!",

Cybersecurity can be overwhelming; we’re told that threat actors are becoming more sophisticated and cyber threats are constantly evolving, yet many security trainings are unhelpful, awful, boring, and too theoretical. There’s nothing worse than imagining your hard work become the next cautionary tale in the media but not know what to do about it. Perhaps you already know security is important but don’t know how where to begin. Maybe you're dealing with a flood of requests from the infosec team, struggling to see the big picture, and unsure how to prioritize their demands among the rest of the backlog. And if the threats are constantly evolving, how do you even keep up and avoid an endless game of security whack-a-mole?\r\n\r\nThankfully, while the threat landscape can seem scary and complex, application security doesn’t have to be. In this talk, learn from Jamie Dicken, former software engineer turned security professional, who will provide practical insights, actionable advice, and a straightforward framework for building secure systems. We’ll cover simple steps you can take throughout the entire product lifecycle and empower you to build resilient systems that can withstand the threats of both today and tomorrow.\r\n",

While your device could expose a web page on some well-known port, you need to get the device connected to a network somehow which means potentially exposing WIFI credentials to the world. A better option is to use Bluetooth LE and a mobile app to control your device. We’ll take a look at Conway's Game of Life running on a Raspberry Pi Pico W and the Android app that controls it. We’ll cover Bluetooth discovery and connection management in .NET, buffered receive callbacks in MicroPython, defining the UI in XAML, and the benefits of MVVM. It’ll be fun! ",

When server responses to browsers were HTML?\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we'll discuss tools like htmx and Hotwire and how they give us a way to build modern feeling web applications from basic HTML responses. By leveraging web standards and the technical advances of browsers, we will reduce both the lines of code we need to write and the amount of knowledge needed to build a fullstack application.\r\n\r\nThis talk isn't about providing a silver bullet solution, but it is a call to action to reexamine how we build things. If you feel like we've overcomplicated things and you're deploying lines of code instead of functionality, this talk is for you.",

We might get a whole page back, or we might get some data to render, but the common thread for almost every web application that has ever been built is the request/response cycle. What if we didn’t have to do it this way? What kind possibilities would open up to us?\r\n\r\nIn this session, we’ll take a simple, existing design pattern that you are probably already familiar with even if you don’t know it by name: the Event/State Reducer pattern. You’ve already used it if you’ve worked with Redux or Elm. We are going to stretch this pattern just a little: we will publish events from the client, use reducer functions on the server to compute our new state, and subscribe to these state changes on the client.\r\n\r\nWe’ll explore this idea with several code examples that gradually increase in complexity. We’ll see how building collaborative and real-time applications becomes natural and straightforward. We’ll also see how to combine statically generated websites with interactive applications in a way that was difficult or impossible before. You can expect to come away with practical but hopefully mind expanding new approaches to building your next application. \r\n",

      "description": "Most bug bounty hunters are missing a huge attack surface when conducting their scans. Often large companies have GeoDNS enabled. If a hunter doesn’t actively bypass GeoDNS by toggling multiple different proxies, or VPNs in different regions, then the hunter only sees the services running on the server located closest to them geographically. The issue with this is that companies often have different services running on servers in different regions. All of which the hunter is missing during their recon phase. \r\n \r\nEnsemble, a free open-source tool being released during Defcon 31, will solve this issue. By creating a load balanced, regionally distributed cluster of nodes and a friendly web portal to control them, Ensemble allows attackers to run identical commands simultaneously across multiple geographic regions. The results of the scans are then aggregated and returned to the hunter in an easy-to-use web platform. These commands can then be scheduled to run regularly so that hunter can get back to focusing on the technical details and not need to focus on manually switching proxy locations, VPNs, and rerunning the same commands over and over again which is highly error prone. \r\n",

How can you be an even more effective mastermind?\r\n\r\nWe’ll look at how the code generation minion operates, how prompting the bot works, and how good testing practice makes for good prompting.

There is a lot of material available to run a coding club, making it a low-lift way to put more STEAM into the world. But the Otterbein chapter is doing things a little bit differently. The team of volunteers has put technology into the tiny hands of middle school students and armed them with software practices such as agile and test-driven development. They’ve designed five years of lesson plans for local school kids. Hear instructors brag about everything the kids have accomplished (as though they did it themselves) and how they have empowered participants to build weird things with technology unapologetically. They will share the fan-favorite activities, failed experiments, and everything that keeps the kids coming back to this STEAM club--from free t-shirts to gender-inclusive policies.

When considering building an AI-powered system or product, the traditional attack surfaces and mitigations still apply. However, new attack surfaces can be present depending on the specific AI approaches used. In addition, due to the typically higher level of automation in AI systems, they can do more harm if they are compromised.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we’ll discuss how AI has the same attack vectors as traditional software, and what those attacks look like. We’ll also discuss new attacks that are specific to generative AI (e.g. LLMs like ChatGPT), machine learning & computer vision systems, and optimization techniques. For each type of attack, we’ll point out how they can be thwarted, or at least mitigated.\r\n\r\nPrevious experience with AI and security are not required to benefit from the session. Attendees will see tools & techniques to help write more secure software, AI-enabled or not. They will walk away with a better understanding of AI-specific attack vectors and their mitigations. They will be equipped to find security education resources in the future.",
