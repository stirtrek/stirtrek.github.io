Many packages bill themselves as a drop-in solution for offline functionality. It just works! Until it doesn’t. 🥲\r\n\r\nWhat to do when things go sideways? We have to dive deep! By understanding the Service Worker lifecycle, caching strategies, and pitfalls, we can equip ourselves with the necessary knowledge to get out of thorny situations. We’ll also look at ways to debug and test your service workers so you can deploy with confidence.",

However, in the case of ChatGPT, those fears are largely unfounded. While it's true that ChatGPT is capable of performing many tasks that were once the exclusive domain of humans, it's important to remember that ChatGPT is a tool, not a replacement for human workers. In fact, ChatGPT has the potential to help people get more done than ever before.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we'll explore the capabilities of ChatGPT and discuss how it can be used to streamline workflows, improve productivity, and make our lives easier. We'll look at real-world examples of how ChatGPT is being used today, from automating customer service to generating creative content. We'll also discuss the ethical considerations of using AI in the workplace and explore how we can ensure that we're using these tools responsibly.\r\n\r\nUltimately, the goal of this talk is to dispel the fear and uncertainty that surrounds AI and to show how ChatGPT can be a powerful ally in the workplace. Whether you're a business owner looking to improve efficiency or an employee looking to streamline your workload, ChatGPT has the potential to help you get things done like never before. So join us as we explore the exciting world of AI and discover how ChatGPT can help you achieve your goals.",

To avoid this, aircraft worldwide constantly and publicly broadcast their location, heading, and all sorts of other data using a system called ADS-B or Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast.\r\n\r\nThis data is a natural fit for a streaming architecture. After all, it’s a constant stream of data that is literally being broadcast in real-time. But how can we capture these broadcasts and the data within? Surely it must require expensive hardware and special tools!\r\n\r\nNot so much. It turns out that we can capture ADS-B data easily using a combination of a cheap radio dongle and free software—a combination called software-defined radio. From there we can store it in a streaming data structure and consume, transform, and publish it using microservices. Cool, right?\r\n\r\nIn this session, you’ll learn how software-defined radio works (and not just for ADB-S), how to receive and store ADS-B data in streams, and how to use those streams with microservices. And, I’ll do it all by example—building a dashboard showing real-time flight data using Node.js, Redis Streams, and whatever front-end JavaScript framework happens to be popular that day!",

And so, it is valuable and critical to understand what each word means individually in order to better understand the ideas they convey collectively.\r\n\r\nSemantics is the study of meaning in words. The session begins with a brief and broad overview of semantics and related ideas. This sets the stage for deep analysis of each individual word in the phrase above and its potential meaning. We collaboratively consider:\r\n\r\nTesters – What might this word mean to different people and in different contexts?\r\nDo/Don’t – What do normative and descriptive statements have to do with it?\r\nHelp – How does the inclusion/exclusion of this word affect the meaning of the phrase?\r\nPrevent/Detect – What does causality and relativism have to do with which word we choose?\r\nProblems – What exactly is the thing that is being prevented or detected?\r\n\r\nThis session demystifies and promotes semantics, and goes beyond wordplay to introduce critical concepts that have practical impacts on testers, their roles, and their responsibilities.",
