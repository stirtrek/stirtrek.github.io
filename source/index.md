            What Do I Get
        </div>
        <div class="comic-panel-body with-header">
            <p>We will be sharing 12 different technical sessions from experts around the software development industry.  It will be one single track, so you also won't have to choose between sessions.  In addition to the content, you will also be able to get exactly the snacks and drinks you want, any the time you want, by walking over to your kitchen during the event.  Make sure to stock up!  There won't be any lines, crowded hallways, or packed theaters to contend with, and all of your favorite things will be there.</p>

            Collaborative Viewing
        </div>
        <div class="comic-panel-body with-header">
            <p>Even though we can't be together in person during the event, we want you to be able to participate in those hallway conversations that are the best part of every conference.  Our Slack community will be an important part of those conversations.  If you're not already a member, head over to <a href="http://stirtrekslack.herokuapp.com">stirtrekslack.herokuapp.com</a> and sign up.  There will be hundreds of us there chatting about what's happening on stage, what's happening in our lives, and what we are all working on.  We can't wait to connect with all of you again.</p>

            FAQ - Sponsors
        </div>
        <div class="comic-panel-body with-header">
            <p class="question">Are there options to sponsor?</p>
            <p>Absolutely! but once again - this is a very limited event, so we don't have as many traditional sponsorship openings as we typically do. If you were a sponsor for 2019/2020, be on the lookout for a separate email from us.</p>
            <p class="question">What happens to my sponsorship that we opted to keep for the next live event?</p>
            <p>Same as an attendee - this event is a totally separate one-off. If you chose to keep your sponsorship from the canceled 2020 event, those aren't going anywhere and you will still be good to go for our next in-person event. As an extra thanks, we will also be sending you a way to get in the front of the line for the same number of tickets to this event as you would normally get for your 2020 sponsorship level.</p>

            What Is Stir Trek?
        </div>
        <div class="comic-panel-body with-header">
            Stir Trek is <em>normally</em> a one-day conference focused on teaching software developers, and others in the industry, the latest and greatest in technologies, techniques, and tools. The full day of content is always concluded with a screening of a blockbuster film on its <i>(originally scheduled)</i> opening day. Pretty sweet, huh?
