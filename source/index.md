            Update: 2021 Virtual Event
        </div>
        <div class="comic-panel-body with-header">
            <p>Ok, we can't take it anymore... We miss all of you and we're tired of waiting.</p>
            <p>And since it's not looking like our live event will happen in May as we had hoped when we canceled last year's event - we have decided to host the first ever:</p>
            <h2 style="text-align: center">STIR TREK: VIRTUAL EDITION on May 7th, 2021!</h2>
            <p>Now, before you get all disappointed that we're going to be virtual (like every other conference and meeting in the last year), we're trying to make this as engaging and entertaining as we can. Also, did we mention that it's going to be free? Think of it like a complimentary side quest as a thanks for being part of our awesome community.</p>
            <p>Tickets will be available starting on 3.14.</p>
            <p>While the exact details, speakers, etc. are still being ironed out, we wanted to make sure we got the word out that this event is in the works and that our (currently limited) supply of free tickets will be available on a first-come, first-served basis. There will also possibly be an even more limited supply of an add-on that will be sold specifically for this event that will have some swag associated. We're still working with our suppliers to see what's possible, how much we can get, etc - so details about this add-on and pricing will be forthcoming.</p>
            <p>So, all that to say, we're REALLY looking forward to seeing you all! (even if only virtually, for now).</p>

            FAQ - Attendees
        </div>
        <div class="comic-panel-body with-header">
            <p class="question">When is the next in-person Stir Trek?</p>
            <p>We're hoping to get together as soon as this fall, but don't hold us to that just yet since there's still a lot of factors that we don't control. Believe us, we are looking at a number of options and thinking out of the box as to how we can successfully get us all together again.</p>
            <p class="question">Will there be a swag box?</p>
            <p>It depends. For the free ticket, you will only get the ability to view the event. But as we said above, we are working with our vendors to see what making some swag will cost, how much we can order, and if we can get it reasonably quickly. Assuming all works out, we will post the list of swag and the add-on price if you want it in addition to the free ticket. That being said, our expectation is that IF we can get some swag, it will most likely be a very limited number of items.</p>
            <p class="question">What happens to my ticket that I purchased in 2020 and opted to keep for the next live event?</p>
            <p>This event is a totally separate one-off. If you chose to keep your tickets from the canceled 2020 event, those aren't going anywhere and you will still be good to go for our next in-person event. As an extra thanks, we will also be sending you a way to get in the front of the line for a ticket to this event.</p>

            FAQ - Sponsors
        </div>
        <div class="comic-panel-body with-header">
            <p class="question">Are there options to sponsor?</p>
            <p>Absolutely! but once again - this is a very limited event, so we don't have as many traditional sponsorship openings as we typically do. If you were a sponsor for 2019/2020, be on the lookout for a separate email from us.</p>
            <p class="question">What happens to my sponsorship that we opted to keep for the next live event?</p>
            <p>Same as an attendee - this event is a totally separate one-off. If you chose to keep your sponsorship from the canceled 2020 event, those aren't going anywhere and you will still be good to go for our next in-person event. As an extra thanks, we will also be sending you a way to get in the front of the line for the same number of tickets to this event as you would normally get for your 2020 sponsorship level.</p>

            What Is Stir Trek?
        </div>
        <div class="comic-panel-body with-header">
            Stir Trek is <em>normally</em> a one-day conference focused on teaching software developers, and others in the industry, the latest and greatest in technologies, techniques, and tools. The full day of content is always concluded with a screening of a blockbuster film on its <i>(originally scheduled)</i> opening day. Pretty sweet, huh?
