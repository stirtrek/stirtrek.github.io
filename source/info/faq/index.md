## Questions

**Q: Does Stir Trek focus on a particular technical platform or environment in its sessions?**

**Q: When do tickets go on sale?**
**A:** The 2020 ticket sale starts on February 27th on [Eventbrite](https://stirtrek2020.eventbrite.com/). In previous years we've sold out in minutes, so mark your calendars!

<hr>

**Q: Is Stir Trek family-friendly?**
**A:** Yes, we absolutely invite families to attend the conference. The majority of content is for professional adults, but if you feel like a member of your family would benefit from attending you can buy that person a ticket. We also make a limited number of additional movie-only tickets available as we get closer to the event.

**Q: Does Stir Trek target any specific “age-span” or educational level?**
**A:** While we are “family oriented” and have sessions and events for the entire family, the majority of the sessions are provided by technology professionals and are adult-oriented.  Anyone interested in technology is invited to attend.

<hr>

**Q: What is the dress code?**
**A:** We would like all attendees to be comfortable during the sessions at Stir Trek.  The dress code is casual but please be mindful that this is a professional community conference and, while not the primary focus, there are some younger attendees so be mindful of them.

**Q: When does the movie start? The schedule says 5:30 but...**
**A:** Popcorn will be available immediately after the last session. Trailers will start shortly after 5pm. The movie will begin by 5:30 (the **actual** movie - not trailers).

**Q: What will lunch include?**
**A:** We want to make sure everyone has good lunch options. When you buy your ticket you will be asked about dietary preferences. Please see the [registration page](/Registration/#mealDetails) for more details.
