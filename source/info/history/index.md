After years of trying to register hundreds of people before the start of the first session (usually with lines stretching around the building, usually in the rain), we decided to just send you everything ahead of time and let you just show up with a badge.

### 2020 "Black Widow Canceled By COVID Edition"

In one of our toughest decisions, we decided to cancel the event in early 2020 as COVID was just gaining a foothold. In hindsight it was the right call but it was still tough for everyone involved in the event.

Here's a trailer for you anyway.
