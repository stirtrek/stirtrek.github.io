      "description": "Ever stared at a complex system and thought, \"Wait, why was that decision made?!” We’ve all been there – lost in a maze of logic, struggling to track down the root cause of a problem. Decision Records offer a brilliant way to finally unlock that understanding. They’re like having a detailed, searchable log of every decision in your applications – from architectural style to authentication to service discovery and containerization. By capturing these decisions, you build more maintainable, auditable, and, frankly, less frustrating systems. In this session, you will learn how decision records solve problems and will be given ideas of templates that you can implement in your projects today! Let’s ditch the guesswork and start documenting the why – because truly understanding your systems is the key to unlocking its full potential!",

      "title": "When Logs Tell the Whole Story: OpenTelemetry for Beginners",
      "description": "Failures in production are a certainty. When something goes wrong, the difference between a quick fix and a prolonged outage often comes down to whether your logs tell a clear, connected story.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we’ll introduce OpenTelemetry as a language-agnostic, vendor-neutral approach to application observability. We'll start with the fundamentals—what logs, traces, and metrics are, why they matter, and how they work together—before focusing on how to use logging effectively rather than excessively.\r\n\r\nAttendees will learn how to structure logs for clarity and correlation, how trace context connects logs across services, and how to choose log levels that provide insight without noise. We’ll also cover common logging anti-patterns, including over-logging and unstructured messages, and how to avoid them to keep both troubleshooting effort and observability costs under control.\r\n\r\nUsing practical, real-world examples, this session will show how OpenTelemetry logging improves debugging, incident response, and overall system understanding. Whether you’re new to observability or replacing a legacy logging approach, you’ll leave with a clear mental model and concrete best practices you can apply immediately.",
