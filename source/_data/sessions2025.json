If you haven’t taken a look lately, this is the perfect time to catch up! We’ll look at recent (and slightly older but lesser-known) developments in HTML and CSS that may surprise you. Who knows: you might even be able to ditch a JS library or two that you didn’t even know you don’t need anymore!",

We'll explore just how Florida Man will do this without losing persistence and without having to drop ACID—that's atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability. And we'll see that Florida Man can have all the CRUD a database provides and the blazing fast speed that a cache provides.\r\n\r\nWe'll do this with an app that would make Florida Man proud. I've cooked up a service that screen scrapes websites with articles featuring his exploits and loads them into Redis—my cache of choice. On top of this, I've built a website that allows users to view and search for articles—using tags, keywords, and vector search.\r\n\r\nI'll show how all of it works—covering the details above—and explain what vector search and embeddings are in a way that even Florida Man could understand. And, of course, I'll demo it live so we can find the Florida Man stories you need to see.\r\n\r\nWhen it's all said and done, you'll see how a cache like Redis can be persistent, ACID-compliant, and even searchable. You'll have an intuitive understanding of vector search, and—best of all—you'll have an app that you can use to start your own projects.",

AI has the potential to revolutionize many industries, but it also presents new challenges and risks. Programmers play a critical role in shaping the development and deployment of AI, and must therefore be aware of its ethical implications.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we will explore the ethical considerations of AI and its impact on society. We will examine the challenges of developing and deploying AI systems that are unbiased, transparent, and accountable. We will discuss the ethical implications of AI in different fields, including healthcare, finance, and transportation. We will also explore the role of programmers in ensuring that AI is developed and deployed ethically.\r\n\r\nFinally, we will discuss best practices for ethical implementation of AI, including designing for transparency, fairness, and accountability. We will also consider the importance of ethical decision-making frameworks and guidelines for AI development and deployment. By the end of this session, participants will have a better understanding of the ethical implications of AI and how they can play a role in ensuring that AI is developed and deployed ethically.",

      "description": "The days of static HTML documents are long gone. Modern user interfaces are dynamic, interactive, and complex. Most of this complexity comes from having to manage and represent concurrent asynchronous processes like requests to the server, timeouts and retries, background processing, native/browser apis, and so on. Frontend frameworks like React are incredibly helpful at constructing a synchronous UI representation of the application state, but force us to orchestrate user events with async processes ourselves. This approach is riddled with issues like race conditions, inconsistent state, UI tearing or flickering, spinner hell, etc.\r\n\r\nThese issues are being addressed by frontend frameworks like React and Solid with new features that eliminate all the asynchronous orchestration and give us consistent UIs by default. This session will explore some of these features, and how they remove a lot of the complexity of building dynamic and asynchronous frontends.",

For example, bus operators complained that they should not have to make their buses accessible because people in wheelchairs did not ride them. Of course they didn’t, because they couldn’t. There is no way to detect whether a visitor to your site has a disability. Are you sure people with disabilities don’t use your site? If they don’t, is it because it is not as accessible as it could be? We can help! \r\n\r\nThis session aims to provide a broad overview of how people with disabilities interact with websites and applications. By examining common assistive technologies, best practices, and real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how to make their websites more inclusive and usable for everyone- regardless of ability. The session will explore how design choices can enhance accessibility for all users.  \r\n\r\nTarget Audience:  \r\n\r\nThis session is targeted at web developers, designers, and accessibility advocates who want to create more inclusive web experiences.

And who *wouldn't* want to work with  [Success Kid](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/success-kid-i-hate-sandcastles).\r\n\r\nBut can we even find out if we have a meme twin? There are lots of memes. And lots of people. How could we possibly search them all? Well, it's easier than you think if we turn those memes into embeddings and search them with a vector database!\r\n\r\nBut what's an embedding? And what's a vector database? Well, that's what I'll cover in this session. I'll begin by exploring embeddings, showing how unstructured data, such as text and images, can be translated into hyper-dimensional arrays—called vectors—using both common and custom AI models. Then I'll talk about vector databases, covering what they are and how you can use them to store and search those embeddings with embeddings of your own.\r\n\r\nOf course, we'll do this all by example. I've turned all the big memes—from [Ancient Aliens Guy](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ancient-aliens) to [Zombie Boy](https://imgflip.com/memegenerator/184608242/zombie-boy)—into embeddings and have loaded them into a vector database. I've built an application around these embeddings and that database. I'll show you the code and the queries of this application so that you can build something similar for yourself. And, most importantly, we'll take some photos during the session and use it all to find your meme twin!\r\n\r\nSo, are you ready to find your meme twin?

Programming languages that are able to target WebAssembly components include Python, C/C++/C#, javascript, rust, and go, with additional languages being rapidly added to this list. Taken together, all this means we have a better way to let users extend our software. Where we used to do an awkward dance of webhooks and API calls, we can now safely (due the no-privilege by default nature of WebAssembly) host and execute user code within our application. In this session, we’ll see how projects like NGINX are embracing WASM components for extending their system. We’ll learn how to build and host WASM components in multiple languages with code examples so you can add WASM component support to your next application. ",

It doesn’t matter if that answer is the best-case, average, or worst-case scenario.\r\n\r\nThe answer is fundamentally wrong because using a single value hides the fact that what we really meant was a distribution of possible dates, durations, or outcomes. The exact value is uncertain. Development may be faster or slower than we thought. What if the tech lead wins the lottery and retires? What if a global pandemic forces us to change the way we work?\r\n\r\nWhile we can’t control any of those factors, we can be mindful of their existence and communicate more clearly. In this talk we will introduce “bet” language, which makes uncertainty and luck an explicit part of the conversation. This mindset helps us accurately assess risks, pick the right risks to embrace, and avoid analysis paralysis. It also helps us learn in an uncertain world, where even if we make good decisions, we may experience bad outcomes (and vice versa!).",

Next, I’ll demonstrate the importance of object ownership in PostgreSQL, how group and user roles can work in unison to effectively manage permissions, multiple ways to manage default privileges, and which privileges should always be modified in any new PostgreSQL database. Finally, I’ll discuss how recent releases are laying a foundation for more flexible and robust security management in the years ahead.\r\n\r\nBy the end of this session, you will understand how roles work in PostgreSQL, how they impact your daily work, and how to effectively communicate security best practices with others on your team. You’ll leave with a solid information to start creating roles that effectively manage access to your cluster and data.",

The other half is understanding what happens if we fail- what it costs us and how it impacts us. \r\nBut the art of threat modeling isn’t just for securing software. Imagine we are security consultants for a medieval kingdom. We will determine the castle’s weak points by planning an attack. We will learn to assess risks by asking what the stronghold, well, um, holds. And we will strengthen our defenses by applying limited resources in the places that will help us the most. By the time we are through, our fortress will be sturdier, we will be able to stave off attacks, and we’ll know what improvements we can make to keep the kingdom safe.\r\nFinally, we will discuss how it applies to development projects and how we can use these techniques to secure software. No expertise in medieval architecture is needed.",

In this session, we'll discover why the pattern is commonly used and how to incorporate it in your own programs.\r\n\r\nWe'll begin with a code free introduction that shows how the pattern is similar to ordering a meal in a diner. Then we'll see how to implement it in Java.\r\n\r\nNext, we'll take an increasingly deep dive into the pattern. You'll learn:\r\n- why the pattern is better than adding setters to a class\r\n- the advantages of Builders in concurrent programming\r\n- several examples of using the Builder pattern in everyday programming\r\n- expert guidance on when to use Builders (and when NOT to)\r\n- how IDEs like IntelliJ can create Builders for you (and why you're better off writing your own)\r\n- using Lombok to implement Builders for older versions of Java\r\n- hints for implementing Builders using Java 14 records\r\n- extending the Builder pattern to TypeScript and Go\r\n- how to effectively prompt ChatGPT to write a Builder for you\r\n- applying the pattern to break a complex API into a simpler, fluent one, such as the API used by ArchUnit\r\n- leveraging the pattern to create your own DSLs (domain specific languages)\r\n\r\nWe will wrap up the session with a question period, and then provide links to the slides for the presentation and a list of resources for further information.\r\n\r\nThis talk is intended for strong beginners, intermediate programmers, or experienced programmers unfamiliar with the pattern. Many of the examples are in Java, but the focus of the talk is language independent, and some examples will be given for Go and TypeScript.",

      "description": "If you prefer to code alone, you might be tempted to buy in to Copilot's claim that it's \"Your AI Pair Programmer.\" You may even feel relief that technology has finally given you a way to get the benefits of pairing without all of that awkward conversation.\r\n\r\nBut this is a placebo—and a costly one. \r\n\r\nCopilot is a tool,  your teammate is a human, and pair and ensemble programming is a human activity. Using a generative AI tool when you write code can be helpful, and it can pretend to be a fellow engineer. But no matter how well it approximates this, it will never replace coding with a person. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, we’ll explore why human pairing matters, and why it's different. This won't be theoretical—I've worked in pairs and ensembles for years,  I'm well-versed in AI-assisted coding, and I've got stories about both.\r\n\r\nYou’ll leave with a renewed appreciation for human teamwork—and ideas on how to make AI tools work with your team, not instead of it.",

He helps narrow their focus to the most important and valuable 'thing', delivering value to the businesses he helps as well as the customers they serve. He has spent time working with a very large, yellow and green, tractor company... adding the ability to 'drive themselves'. He has also spent lots of time working on building Autonomous Drive Systems (ADS) for the automotive industry. The last couple of years building a testing platform that enables software developers unfamiliar with the process of testing the interface between hardware and software to do so, quickly and efficiently.\r\n\r\nSome notable clients include Enron, John Deere, Ford, FiniteState, Path Robotics, NuCamp, Crown, DriveOhio, Case New Holland, Fiat Chrysler, Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure/MCVP.\r\n\r\nOutside of work, DJ can usually be found on two wheels—bicycling or motorcycling.
