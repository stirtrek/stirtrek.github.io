# COVID-19 Policy
<div class="icon-hr"></div>

As Stir Trek continues to monitor the local, national and worldwide incidence of the coronavirus and the illness it causes, COVID-19, we want to make sure that we have updated guidance related to our event. It is likely this information will change as the situation evolves, and this page will contain the most up-to-date information we have. Questions may be directed to [info@stirtrek.com](mailto:info@stirtrek.com).


Stir Trek’s priorities in setting these policies are to minimize the transmission of contagious disease.

<br>

***Based on the current CDC and governmental guidelines, we are not currently requiring masks, vaccines, or proof of a negative COVID test.  We still ask everyone to use their discretion in keeping a healthy distance from others when possible, and we do not discourage the wearing of masks by any individual.***

<br>

**Most Important Actions to Take Now**
1. All attendees and staff are urged to take basic preventive measures to avoid exposure to or infection by the virus causing COVID-19. This includes social distancing, wearing a facecovering, and getting the vaccine.

2. If you feel sick at all, stay at home and monitor your symptoms.

If public health conditions worsen, Stir Trek’s policies may be further amended. This would be done to address the effects of more widespread illness, and to limit the spread.  

Thank you for your understanding.
