                "description": "Root Insurance is the nation’s first licensed insurance carrier powered entirely by mobile and founded on the principle that car insurance rates should be based on how you drive, not who you are. We use data science and technology to identify and insure good drivers, reducing insurance premiums for good drivers as a result. Car insurance is a compulsory product — it’s literally illegal to drive without it. Unfortunately, people are paying significantly more than they should be because their car insurance carrier only looks at their demographics and not how they drive. We’re fixing that. Root was started in 2015 with backing from Drive Capital. Although creating an insurance carrier from scratch was an audacious undertaking, we realized we needed to own everything end-to-end to build an exceptional insurance experience. With schlep blindness in full effect, we made it happen. Most insurance carriers were started a century ago and are running on an amalgamation of technology that is decades old. Root is the manifestation of “software is eating the world” in insurance. Our core expertise is responding to trends in technology by incorporating new sources of data into insurance pricing and building great products and user experiences on top of it. Root is where it is today due to the hard work, ingenuity, and exceptional performance of the people here. We’ve been fortunate to build an incredibly talented team that has brought this idea to life, and we're striving to grow that team by hiring more exceptional people.",
