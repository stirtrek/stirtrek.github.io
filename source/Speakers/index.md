## Travel Reimbursements & Training Budgets
We're very pleased to announce that we're expanding our speaker training program (from 12 speakers, to 24 this year!) while retaining our **$250 speaker travel reimbursement**. 

### Training
If you've been selected as a speaker, you'll have the option to join a professional speaker training course we've partnered with [Articulation](https://www.articulationinc.com/) to provide. They coach all the TEDx Columbus speakers, and did a great job last year. This is **completely free to you**. More details are coming soon.

### Travel
Additionally, for the 2nd year in a row we're committing to a minimum of $250 of travel reimbursements to any speaker than needs them. Depending on how many speakers travel, we may be able to cover more. More details are coming soon.

Allowed expenses include transit, hotel, and fuel. If you have a different expense you'd like to include, please email speakers@stirtrek.com. You'll need to book your own travel reservations and submit a receipt on or after the day of the event to get reimbursed.
