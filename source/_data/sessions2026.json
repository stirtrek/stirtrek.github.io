      "description": "Most programmers don't start projects from scratch, but inherit them. Often, we join large, messy, years-old code bases that are poorly tested and documented, and are intimidating to work with. Working with them can feel like tap dancing through a mine field.\r\n\r\nGenerative AI also provides challenges for software developers, as it can generate huge amounts of code that need to be understood.\r\n\r\nThis talk offers practical strategies for navigating and improving legacy code. We'll see techniques like using git history with scripts to identify software hot spots, introducing software \"seams\" for safe refactoring, and isolating risky changes through \"sprouting\" and \"wrapping\" techniques. You'll see how small, strategic changes can introduce stability without requiring massive rewrites.\r\n\r\nAttendees will leave with concrete, proven techniques for understanding, modifying, and improving legacy code bases with confidence.

      "description": "In the world of software, products and systems don’t just remain static, they evolve, accumulate technical debt, and sometimes become an unmanageable mess of outdated frameworks, workarounds, and fragile dependencies. \r\n\r\nWhen dealing with a 15-year-old platform, the question isn’t just how to modernize but what to modernize. Should you refactor piece by piece or completely rebuild? What about adding that new feature for the Product Owner. The answer isn’t always obvious.\r\n\r\nThis session explores how blending product thinking with software modernization leads to better outcomes. We’ll examine the lens of long-term product strategy, user needs, and business value. Using real-world lessons from a long-running SaaS product, a case study in modernizing a complex legacy platform, we’ll highlight how to balance technical constraints with customer expectations.\r\n\r\nWhether you’re leading a legacy transformation or trying to avoid one in the future, this talk will showcase some smart modernization decisions that don’t make the business take a full stop.",

Much like martial arts training, pipelines built on shaky fundamentals tend to collapse under pressure.\r\n\r\nThis session focuses on practical data pipeline design patterns that emphasize durability, maintainability, and operational confidence. Drawing from experience modernizing enterprise data platforms, I’ll walk through common failure modes in batch and streaming pipelines and how disciplined upfront design decisions can prevent them.\r\n\r\nWe’ll cover topics such as schema evolution, idempotency, observability, testing strategies, and scaling — grounded in real examples of what worked, what broke, and what we had to correct after the fact. There are no silver bullets here — just repeatable patterns and lessons learned from systems that had to stay running while everything around them changed.\r\n\r\nThis talk is tool-agnostic and focused on principles that apply whether you’re using Python, Spark, Kafka, or traditional ETL platforms.\r\n\r\nWhat’s in it for the attendee\r\n- How to design pipelines that withstand change and growth\r\n- Patterns for building observability and testability into data systems\r\n- Common anti-patterns that lead to brittle pipelines\r\n- Practical guidance rooted in real production experience",

It’s no longer just about defending systems—our choices around power, hardware, and supply chains also shape how secure those systems really are.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I’ll explore why sustainability belongs in the security conversation. We’ll look at practical steps—like energy-efficient tools, leaner software, greener data centers, and responsible hardware lifecycles—that cut waste and costs while strengthening defenses. Just as importantly, we’ll examine how unstable supply chains, poor sourcing, or unreliable power can become security risks in themselves.\r\n\r\nWe’ll also connect this to risk and compliance: how building sustainability into security reduces exposure, steadies supply chains, and keeps organizations ahead of changing expectations. With real-world examples, you’ll walk away with a clear sense of how sustainability and security reinforce each other, and how to apply that thinking in your own work.\r\n",

      "description": "When Roxy’s son was hospitalized yet again, she noticed nurses struggling to calculate his g-tube feed rates, so she built solution with simply HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, then almost didn’t share it due to everyone’s favorite pal, imposter syndrome. This talk chronicles a very specific calculator’s evolution into a production React PWA with AI integration, now used daily by families worldwide, who even find it through organic Google searches. Through honest code comparisons, you’ll see when vanilla JavaScript hits its limits, why React’s patterns became necessary, and how AI tools can accelerate development while you continue learning. You’ll also leave with a six-step framework for iterative development that overcomes the fear of shipping imperfect solutions. Whether you’re considering a React migration, curious about AI-assisted development, or sitting on a side project, you’ll leave with technical insights and a renewed motivation to ship.",

      "description": "In the quest for rapid software delivery, DevOps principles are misapplied or skipped entirely, leading to a “DevOops culture.” In this talk we'll explore DevOps missteps through a satirical narrative where missteps and bad practices are presented as the path forward.\r\n\r\nTo start, we’ll discuss deploying code the way of the masochist. This will include a convincing argument for detail-oriented change requests and late-night deployments to prevent any witnesses to our misdeeds. Following this, we will outline our project mismanagement philosophy for maintaining constant chaos: embracing siloes and eliminating feedback loops. Finally, we'll present why quality assurance is overrated and unnecessary. Instead, we'll present the benefits of zero testing and disabling quality and security tools – they are just like that “check engine” light in the car: useless and annoying.\r\n\r\nTogether we’ll see how easy it is to establish the worst DevOps culture for modern software delivery: a DevOops culture! \r\n\r\nOr not. While this talk is tongue in cheek, we will see how to overcome these all-to-real mindsets. By the time we are done, we'll have navigated the treacherous waters of software misadventures with a wink and a smile so we can march forward, turning our ‘oopses’ into opportunities and our code catastrophes into triumphs.",

This talk is a practical overview for developers who want to understand what quantum computing actually is, why it matters, and where it's headed. We'll walk through the core concepts like superposition, entanglement, and interference without the math-heavy deep dive. You'll see what quantum computers are good at, what they're not, and how they might affect the systems and security decisions you make in the future. No physics background required. You'll walk away with enough understanding to follow the conversation and recognize when quantum starts to matter for your work. ",

      "description": "Failures in production are a certainty. When something goes wrong, the difference between a quick fix and a prolonged outage often comes down to whether your logs tell a clear, connected story.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we’ll introduce OpenTelemetry as a language-agnostic, vendor-neutral approach to application observability. We'll start with the fundamentals—what logs, traces, and metrics are, why they matter, and how they work together—before focusing on how to use logging effectively rather than excessively.\r\n\r\nAttendees will learn how to structure logs for clarity and correlation, how trace context connects logs across services, and how to choose log levels that provide insight without noise. We’ll also cover common logging anti-patterns, including over-logging and unstructured messages, and how to avoid them to keep both troubleshooting effort and observability costs under control.\r\n\r\nUsing practical, real-world examples, this session will show how OpenTelemetry logging improves debugging, incident response, and overall system understanding. Whether you’re new to observability or replacing a legacy logging approach, you’ll leave with a clear mental model and concrete best practices you can apply immediately.",
