# 2021 Call for Speakers
<div class="icon-hr"></div>

This year we will *not* be doing a public CFP and are going to favor the speakers we selected and had to cancel on in 2020. Because we only have 12 sessions (instead of 48) in a single track, we think this will help us build the best possible virtual conference.

We love how excited our speaker community gets about Stir Trek and we really can't wait until our next normal conference. Keep the great ideas flowing, be safe, get vaccinated when you can, and plan to join us next year!

# Returning 2020 Speakers

If you're one of the speakers that was selected in 2020, please watch your email for more details!
