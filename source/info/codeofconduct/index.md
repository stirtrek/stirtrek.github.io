# Our Code of Conduct
<div class="icon-hr"></div>

All delegates, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at any Stir Trek event are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event.

## The Quick Version

Stir Trek is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organizers.

## The Less Quick Version

At Stir Trek, we assume that most people are intelligent and well-intended, and we're not inclined to tell people what to do. However, recent events indicate that sometimes it's necessary to spell out the behavior we support and discourage at our conference. The core of our approach is this: we will do whatever we believe is necessary to ensure that Stir Trek attendance, speakers, staff, and guests will have a fun, safe and productive environment.  Any form of harassment will not be tolerated.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.

Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.

We expect participants to follow these rules at all conference venues and conference-related social events.  Please bring any concerns to the immediate attention of the event staff, or contact us at either [jeff@stirtrek.com](mailto:jeff@stirtrek.com) or [codeofconduct@stirtrek.com](mailto:codeofconduct@stirtrek.com). We thank our attendees for their help in keeping the event welcoming,respectful, and friendly to all participants.
