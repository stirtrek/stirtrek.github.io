 # Our Privacy Policy
<div class="icon-hr"></div>

## Privacy Statement
The information collected from our attendees as part of the registration process is only used by Stir Trek. Our goal is to improve
on the overall experience for the years ahead.

**Personally Identifiable Information:** We use the term "personally identifiable information" to mean any information that could reasonably be used to identify you, including your name, address, e-mail address, credit card information, or any combination of information that could be used to identify you.

**Dissemination of your Personally Identifiable Information:** We do not sell any personally identifiable information collected through our ticket registration or our website. Your personal information will remain confidential and be used only by Stir Trek. Aggregated demographic information may be made available to our partners, speakers or attendees, but at no time will that information be linked to your personal information in a public manner or sold to any third parties.

## Badge Scanning
Stir Trek vendors and partners use a proprietary badge-scanning application that we developed in house to protect your personal information. The information from your ticket registration (Name, City, State, Country, Title, Company, and Email) will only be shared with vendors you permit to scan your badge. The NFC tag on your badge, activated when you register, contains only your name and an id to
tie back to our servers.
