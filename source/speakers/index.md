# This Year's Speakers

<div class="icon-hr"></div>

We’re excited about this awesome group of speakers and sessions for 2026.

The CFP opened on January 12, 2026 and closed on January 25. We received 349
sessions from 129 speakers, and we now have our team of 10 reviewers doing the hard work of reading all of the abstracts
and making tough decisions about which sessions make it and which sessions don't.

If you submitted sessions this year, our team of reviewers is making their way through all the sessions, trying their
best to select the sessions that will make this the best Stir Trek ever! We hope to notify selected
speakers sometime before the end of February.

If you missed submitting this year, our CFP normally opens the first week of January and is only open for two weeks.
Check back late in 2026 to find out when the 2027 CFP will open.

If you have any questions, please reach out to us at speakers@stirtrek.com.
