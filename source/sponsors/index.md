Without our sponsors' support, we would never have made it this many years. Please consider joining us (and our 2,000 closest developer friends) on Friday May 2nd, 2025, as a sponsor.  You won't be disappointed!

There are three steps to secure your organization's spot!

1) Review the [prospectus](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LNdkbOohdJ26QfRN0mgd58fKaNu84JqAHVSsDLuVYSI/edit#slide=id.g31ad3242584_0_7) and choose your level of engagement.  Spots are limited and the earliest responses get the best booth locations.
2) Go to the [sponsor portal](https://stirtreksponsor.myshopify.com/) and secure your spot by filling out your contact info, company name and logo(s).  Don't worry, if you aren't planning to pay by credit card, you can mail a check in later.
3) Review any exclusive a la carte sponsorship options.  These are listed at the bottom of the prospectus.

Note: If you are interested in capitalizing on your engagement in a special way, Stir Trek is always interested in partnering to support creative ideas that benefit our community in some way.  Please reach out to [sponsors@stirtrek.com](mailto:sponsors@stirtrek.com) if you have questions or would like to brainstorm.

## 2025 Sponsors and Partners

<div class="icon-hr"></div>

Stir Trek wouldn't be possible without the support of our sponsors. They fund a large portion of the conference costs so that we can keep ticket costs affordable.

Please take a few minutes to learn about our sponsors and let them know you appreciate their support of our community!
