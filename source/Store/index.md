##  Help Stir Trek out and get awesome swag

Cancelling Stir Trek 2020 is expensive! We've already spent at least **$25,000** that we can't get back, and we're in the process of refunding every attendee and sponsor that wants one.

You can help us and the Stir Trek community keep going and get *awesome* swag at the same time. How is that? [By buying swag through our new online store!](https://www.marktapparel.com/store/c55/Stir_Trek.html)

We've currated a selection of brand new items and previous Stir Trek shirts that we can reprint, in both men's and women's cuts where possible.
