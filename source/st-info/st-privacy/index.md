 # Our Privacy Policy
<div class="icon-hr"></div>

## Privacy Statement
The information collected from our attendees as part of the registration process is only used by Stir Trek. Our goal is to improve
on the overall experience for the years ahead.

**Personally Identifiable Information:** We use the term "personally identifiable information" to mean any information that could reasonably be used to identify you, including your name, address, e-mail address, credit card information, or any combination of information that could be used to identify you.

**Dissemination of your Personally Identifiable Information:** We do not sell any personally identifiable information collected through our ticket registration or our website. Your personal information will remain confidential and be used only by Stir Trek. Aggregated demographic information may be made available to our partners, speakers or attendees, but at no time will that information be linked to your personal information in a public manner or sold to any third parties.

## Badge Scanning
Stir Trek vendors and partners use a badge-scanning application that. The information from your ticket registration (Name and Email only) will only be shared with vendors you permit to scan your badge. The QR tag on your badge, activated when you register, contains only your name and email to tie back to our servers.  If you wish to opt out of this, there will be a sticker in your registration box to cover up your QR code.
